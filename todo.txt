TODO:

- email address validation in review step.
- integrate domainprices, to parse domain and get actual prices
- Luhn validator for credit card numbers.
- Update on attribute change (explore complexity trade off first)
- add UI tests
- separate out styles, implement alternates (e.g. accordion flow), support overrides.
- themes support, (explore complexity trade-off first, simple and unintrusive to business logic).

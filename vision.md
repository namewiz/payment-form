The ideal library package is one that is easy to maintain, to use and to scale.

- It should have zero or minimal dependencies - this avoids breakages due to API changes, supply chain attacks etc.
- It should be documented properly. The readme and other docs reflect the current state of the code, including any naunces in its implementation or usage.
- It is covered by high quality tests, especially around core functionality. The tests do not use mocks. The tests use native test frameworks. The tests are composed well to make extending them easy.
- It should have a minimal footprint (as few files and absractions as possible) - this reduces cognitive load in finding affected files. It ensures each file or class wholesomely delivers a distinctive value.
- It should be production-ready: have debug logging instrumented (e.g. with verbose param), have analytics (gtag) for core journeys/milestones, support i18n, have great documentation, be consistently formatted,


For the library, my vision is standalone, configurable payment form that I can integrate in the domain purchase flows of different domain registrars.
